## Wikipedia App

Wikipedia is a free content and internet-based encyclopedia platform. It is a resource with articles on many different topics that users can contribute and edit. The most distinctive feature of Wikipedia is that it provides an environment where users can collectively produce and edit content.

Wikipedia's main purpose is to share information freely and make it accessible to all. Content on Wikipedia is often created and updated by volunteer contributing editors. Anyone can add new articles to Wikipedia, correct or expand existing articles, in accordance with the principles of bibliography and accuracy.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
